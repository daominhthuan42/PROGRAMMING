Regarding the sample program 9, add following function.
(1) After creating 3 initial data (prepared in program 9),
insert element 4 after element 1. (element 4 data is "grape")
[Expand exercise]
(2) Get “insert number” and “fruit name” by "scanf", and insert the element to the LIST.

Regarding the sample program 9, add following function.
(1) After create initial 3 data (prepared in program 9),
remove element 2.
[Expand exercise]
(2) Get “remove number” by "scanf", and remove the element from the LIST.

void deleteElement_2(struct leaf *pL)
{
    struct leaf *pLnext;
    pLnext = pL->next;
    printf("remove element 2:   %s\n", pLnext->data);
    free(pLnext);
    printf("done remove");
}
